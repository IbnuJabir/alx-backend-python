# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

This directory contains projects focused on Python variable annotations, a feature introduced in Python 3.6. Variable annotations allow developers to include type hints in their code, which can improve code readability and help with debugging.

## Learning Objectives

By completing the tasks in this project, you will be able to:

- Understand and implement variable annotations in Python.
- Use type hints to provide better documentation and understandability of your Python code.
- Work with third-party tools like `mypy` for static type checking.

## Project Structure

- **Task 0**: [Function with type hints](./task_0.py) - Create a function that uses variable annotations.
- **Task 1**: [Annotated variables](./task_1.py) - Annotate variables with appropriate types.
- **Task 2**: [Function annotations](./task_2.py) - Develop a function that uses function annotations effectively.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher.
- Adherence to [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) for type hinting.
- Use of type hinting in all function and variable declarations.

## Usage

To run the scripts in this directory, ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed. You can execute any of the scripts using the command:

```bash
python3 task_0.py
```

Replace `task_0.py` with the appropriate script name.
