# ALX Backend Python

This repository contains a series of projects and exercises focused on backend development using Python. The projects are part of the ALX Software Engineering program, emphasizing key backend concepts and Python programming practices.

## Overview

The ALX Backend Python curriculum is designed to build a solid foundation in backend development with Python. The projects cover various aspects of backend engineering, including:

- Python fundamentals and advanced features.
- Data manipulation and algorithms.
- Web development frameworks.
- API development and integration.
- Database management and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

## Project Structure

Each directory within the repository represents a different project or topic area. Here are some of the key projects:

- **0x00-python_variable_annotations**: Introduction to Python variable annotations and type hinting.
- **0x01-python_asyncio**: Exploring asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` library.
- **0x02-python_restful_api**: Building RESTful APIs using popular frameworks like Flask and Django.
- **0x03-python_orms**: Working with ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) to interact with databases in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher.
- Familiarity with basic Python syntax and programming concepts.
- Understanding of web development and backend principles.

## Getting Started
